    # Here we override the default values from cluster-standup-teardown and make the following changes:
    #
    # 1. Increase min size from 2 to 3 because of issues discovered on 14/06/2024, where after the upgrade
    #    cluster-autoscaler scales down the cluster to min size (which is 2 by default) and after that a lot of Pods
    #    cannot be scheduled. The result is that Upgrade suite fails because WC Deployments are not ready, as test
    #    time-out passes more quickly than cluster-autoscaler can scale up the cluster.
    #
    # 2. Disable spot instances for CAPA upgrade suite, as we suspect that using spot instances is causing Upgrade suite
    #    failures. E.g. node pool gets scaled down to 1 instance only after the upgrade, while the min size is 3.
